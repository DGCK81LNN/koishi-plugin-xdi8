    description: Hanzi ↔︎ Shidinn conversion
    arguments:
      text: text
    usage: |-
      When the "all" option is enabled, normally hidden results including legacy spellings and traditional variants of Hanzi will be shown.
      When the input is a single Hanzi or Shidinn "word", however, almost all otherwise hidden results will be included without having to enable the "all" option.
    options:
      all: show hidden results
    messages:
      input: <b>Shidinn transcribe:</b> {0}
      no-result: Nothing to transcribe.
  xdi8-grep:
    description: Find shidinn words by regular expression
    arguments:
      pattern: 正则表达式
    usage: |-
      Special escape sequences are available for matching categories of Shidinn letters:
      \c — consonant
      \g — glide
      \v — vowel
      For example, "\c\g\v.H" matches words in the form CGVRH.
      Capitalize the escape to select any shidinn letter <i>not</i> belonging to the respective category; for example, \C matches a non-consonant.
    options:
      legacy: legacy spellings only
    messages:

    description: Render Shidinn letters to image
    usage: |-
      Render Shidinn Chat Alphabet or PUA Encoding with a Shidinn font, optionally annotating Hanzi with rubytext.
      Option "x2h" disables annotating Hanzi in the input, instead converting Shidinn words to Hanzi. Words must be separated by spaces.
    arguments:
      text: 文本
    options:
      all: When working with Hanzi, show all possible conversion results.
      x2h: Shidinn to Hanzi mode
    messages:
      no-shidinn-letter-or-hanzi: No Shidinn letter or annotatable Hanzi found.
      no-shidinn-word: "No valid Shidinn word found. (note: separate words with spaces)"
  lnnzhyz:
    description: Render LNNZHYZ
    arguments:
      text: text
    usage: |-
      Input format: Separate words with spaces, and separate <i>zi</i> within a word with underscores. Add a "^" before a zi to insert a proper name mark. Replace an underscore with a dash to insert a hyphen.
      "Input type" accepts one of these values:
          <i>xdi8</i> or <i>shidinn</i> (Shidinn Chat Alphabet)
          <i>mandarin</i> ("Semi-Modified Pinyin")
          <i>notation</i> (LNNZHYZ serialization notation)
      You can also use the initial letters of these keywords as short options: -x, -s, -m, -n
    options:
      type: Input type
      compile: Convert input to serialization notation only
    messages:
      no-valid-phrase: Nothing to transcribe.
      cannot-compile-notation: Input type cannot be "notation" when the compile mode is enabled.
